# WhatsApp Subscription Reminder System

A small automation system built to manage subscription expiry dates
and send WhatsApp reminders automatically.

This is a real system used in real conditions, not a polished product.

---

## Problem

I manage multiple subscriptions with different expiry dates.
Manually tracking and reminding users was error-prone and time-consuming.

I needed a simple system that:
- Tracks expiry dates
- Sends WhatsApp reminders automatically
- Alerts me when something breaks

---

## Constraints

- Google Sheets as the database
- No dedicated backend server
- WhatsApp API can fail or expire (QR-based)
- Must be easy to maintain solo

---

## Architecture

- **Google Sheets** — subscription data
- **Google Apps Script** — automation & scheduling
- **WhatsApp API** — message delivery
- **Health checks & fail-safe alerts** — detect failures early

---

## Key Features

- Expiry detection (tomorrow & yesterday)
- Idempotent reminders (no duplicate sends)
- Failure streak detection & auto-block
- Admin WhatsApp + email alerts
- Health check system

## Code Structure

This repository contains a simplified and sanitized version of the production system.

apps-script/
├── core-engine.gs      # Expiry check & scheduling logic
├── whatsapp-client.gs # WhatsApp send abstraction (sanitized)
├── health-check.gs    # Health checks & failure detection
├── utils.gs           # Helpers (date handling, formatting)

Sensitive configuration values (API keys, phone numbers, IDs) are intentionally omitted.

## Lessons Learned

- External APIs will fail — design for it
- Idempotency is critical for cron-based systems
- Logs and alerts matter more than optimism
- Simple systems can still break in complex ways
